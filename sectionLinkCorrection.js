This example uses the pre-class/in-class/post-class structure to organise material. Other learning pathways include ‘Prepare, Explore, Apply’, and ‘Something to read, something to watch, something to discuss’.

What’s important about this resource/activity? What do you expect students to gain from this?</li><li><strong>Content:</strong> a variety of content styles (eg, text, readings, videos, images and interactive activities) are packaged so that they fit on a screen and are easily navigable for students.</li><li><strong>Design:</strong> ensure accessibility and usability of the site by all your students (and screen readers). Use black text on a white background; instead of using colour to create emphasis, use heading options or text format options such as bold, italic and underline features; left-align text to optimise readability; use spacing, indenting, numbering and bullet points to break down larger pieces of text.</li></ul></div>');

In the Arts Faculty, the preferred approach for online teaching is to transform (rather than replicate) the traditional lecture, by reimagining how you might teach using the advantages of the available technologies. This includes using a mixture of asynchronous (e.g., recorded videos, polls, forums) and synchronous (e.g., zoom) activities. You might even choose to remove your synchronous class altogether and instead utilise the full functionality of moodle to create rich, challenging and engaging tasks where students can apply their learning.</p><p>The templates below enable you to curate the following content and materials for students, considering the sequencing of the learning experience, and based on the learning goals for the week:</p><ul><li>Short lecturer-created videos to introduce key concepts, theories, frameworks</li><li>Key readings with guiding questions, signposting for students</li><li>Curated content such as youtube clips, websites</li><li>Opportunities for students to explore and apply the new concepts through a variety of activities</li><li>Opportunities for students to interact with other</li><li>Check points for student learning such as self-assessment, check/reflect on learning, both assessed/non-assessed</li><li>Establish and maintain a rapport with students and provide opportunities for consultation</li><li>Further readings and resources to support assessment and extend students</li></ul><p>Decide whether you will deliver your content using a Moodle lesson or Moodle book:</p><ul><li><img src="https://lms.monash.edu/theme/image.php/monash/lesson/1588788791/icon" alt="Moodle lesson icon" />Lessons provide a structure for a set learning sequence where content is scaffolded and linked. Lesson content can be interspersed with check-your-learning questions and activities that you can connect through to gradebook. You can set restrictions in a lesson so students cannot progress through the material unless they complete a question or activity.</li><li><img src="https://lms.monash.edu/theme/image.php/monash/book/1588788791/icon" alt="Moodle book icon" />Books provide a more flexible, open structure where students can access \'chapters\' in any order.</li></ul></div>');

This is a centralised approach to communication, that may work better for your context than responding to individual student emails.</li></ul></li><li>Q & A where students respond to a thread the lecturer starts, and then see all other student responses.</li></ul><p>This section or the overview section (or both) is a great opportunity to scaffold how you want students to communicate with the teaching staff, and with each other. Provide instructions on what you are comfortable with students emailing you for - special consideration, extensions - and where you want certain questions posted - assessment questions in the assessment section, general questions not answered elsewhere in the communication section, weekly activities in the forums within the weeks.</p><p>You can also set activity completion options such as the number of times a student can post to a forum, and require a certain number of posts and responses.
